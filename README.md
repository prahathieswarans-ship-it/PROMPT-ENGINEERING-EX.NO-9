## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Explore Video Generation Models**  
   Study text-to-video AI tools such as:
   - Runway Gen-2  
   - Synthesia  
   - Pictory  
   - DeepBrain  

   Understand their capabilities, limitations, and output styles.

2. **Create Simple Prompts**  
   Begin with basic prompts to generate short videos.  
   **Example:**  
   `A person walking in a park.`

3. **Use Detailed Prompts**  
   Add details such as lighting, setting, actions, and colors.  
   **Example:**  
   `A person in a red jacket walking on a sunny park path, birds flying above, and a dog running beside them.`

4. **Add Time and Motion Elements**  
   Include transitions, camera movement, or timing.  
   **Example:**  
   `A time-lapse of the sun setting over the ocean with the camera slowly zooming out.`

5. **Test Different Video Styles**  
   Experiment with cinematic, animated, live-action, or artistic styles.  
   **Example:**  
   `An animated futuristic city with neon lights and flying cars.`

6. **Iterate and Refine Prompts**  
   Modify prompts and regenerate videos to achieve better pacing, clarity, or visual effects.

7. **Generate Multiple Versions**  
   Compare versions of the same prompt to observe differences in motion, quality, and artistic style.

8. **Save and Compare Outputs**  
   Store generated video outputs and analyze how prompt changes affect results.

## 📝 Example Prompt Used
A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park pathway, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them.
---

## 🖥️ System Response (from AI Video Generation App)
The prompt was entered into the AI video-generation application (Runway Gen-2 / Pika Labs / Luma AI).  
The application processed the provided text and **successfully generated a short video clip** based on the described scene.

---

## ✅ Result
The exploration of prompting techniques for AI video generation was successfully completed.  
All prompts were entered into the AI video-generation application, and the system generated corresponding video outputs.  
The experiment clearly demonstrated how variations in prompting influence the style, motion, and quality of AI-generated videos.
